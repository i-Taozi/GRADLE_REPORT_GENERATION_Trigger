    - The bukkit.org resource page has been disable and suggests using LuckPerms instead.

# Obsolete Warning for PEX

Since PEX has been abandoned and has no support, it is strongly suggested that you use LuckPerms or another permission manager instead. If you do decide to use PEX then you do so at your own risk.  We reserve the right not to spend time addressing issues that may be resolve with a more modern permission manager.
