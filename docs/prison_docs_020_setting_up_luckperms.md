# Warning about LuckPerms Versions

Due to how LuckPerms registers with the Spigot Plugin Manager, it will cause plugins to fail if they were designed for the older LuckPerms version.  Therefore, plugins can only be used with the version of LuckPerms that they were designed for and it's up to the server owner to be able to figure that out on their own.

**Prison plugin v3.2.0** *only* works with LuckPerms v4.4.1 and older. Luckperms v4.4.1 is the suggested version and can be downloaded here:
[LuckPerms v4.4.1](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin.28140/history "LuckPerms v4.4.1 can be found under the Version History tab")

**Prison plugin v3.2.1** and newer works with *any* version of LuckPerms. It is suggested that LuckPerms v5.0.x is used, but you may also use LuckPerms v4.4.1.
