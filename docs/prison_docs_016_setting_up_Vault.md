## Setting up Vault

This document provides a quick overview on how to install Vault.

Vault may be optional, but it is a very important plugin.  It provides easy integration with economies and permissions.  This is useful because its a standard way for prison to hook in and use any plugin that supports Vault.

# Optional Dependencies

There aren't any required dependencies to using Vault, but Vault will be useless if there were no other plugins to hook in to it.

The two most useful plugins to use would be EssentialsX and LuckPerms.  EssentialsX is useful for its economy, and LP for the permissions.
