## Setting up WorldGuard and WorldEdit

Although Prison does not directly utilize WorldGuard or WorldEdit, both of these plugins can be critical in setting up a functional Prison server.

WorldGuard requires WorldEdit to work.
WorldGuard can be used to restrict players from entering and using mines that they should not have access to. 


This short document just explains how to install these plugins.  Other documents will go in to greater detail on how to setup and use WorldGuard regions to protect your mines and to limit players from going in to mines they do not have access to.

Of course you don't need to use WorldGuard and WorldEdit, these are just presenting one possibility for your sever. Other options exist.
